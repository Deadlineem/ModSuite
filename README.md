## 📁 Excluding ModSuite from Antivirus Scans

To ensure ModSuite functions properly without interruptions (especially for downloading and injecting mods), it's **highly recommended** to exclude the following folder from your antivirus:

### ➤ Exclusion Path:

> %APPDATA%\ModSuite
Note: If you do not see the folder, press one of the download buttons and it will be created, or, optionally, create it yourself.


### 💡 How to Add an Exclusion (Windows Defender):

1. Open **Windows Security**  
2. Click on **Virus & threat protection**  
3. Scroll down and click **Manage settings** under *Virus & threat protection settings*  
4. Scroll to **Exclusions** and click **Add or remove exclusions**  
5. Click **Add an exclusion** ➜ Choose **Folder**  
6. Paste or browse to:  
> %APPDATA%\ModSuite

7. Confirm and close settings

This will prevent false positives and allow ModSuite to run and inject mods without interference.
